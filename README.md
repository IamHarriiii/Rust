# Rust 🦀 Study Repository

Welcome to the **Rust** GitHub repository! This repo is dedicated to my journey of learning the Rust programming language from scratch. It will include notes, code samples, mini-projects, exercises, and other resources as I progress through various learning stages.

---

## 📚 Purpose

This repository serves as:

- A structured collection of all my Rust learning materials
- A place to track my progress over time
- A reference for revisiting core Rust concepts
- A showcase of mini-projects and experiments

---

## 🧠 What You'll Find

The repository will be organized into directories based on learning modules or topics, such as:

- `basics/`: syntax, variables, data types, control flow
- `ownership/`: ownership, borrowing, lifetimes
- `structs_enums/`: defining and using structs and enums
- `collections/`: vectors, hashmaps, strings, slices
- `functions/`: closures, higher-order functions
- `traits_generics/`: generics, traits, trait bounds
- `error_handling/`: `Result`, `Option`, error propagation
- `modules/`: project structure, module system, crates
- `asynchronous/`: async programming, futures, tokio
- `mini_projects/`: small Rust-based apps and utilities
- `notes/`: markdown notes and references
- `resources/`: external learning resources and links
